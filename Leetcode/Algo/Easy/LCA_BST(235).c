235. Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Search Tree

Given a binary search tree (BST), find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes in the BST.

According to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia: “The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes p and q as the lowest node in T that has both p and q as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself).”

Example 1:
Input: root = [6,2,8,0,4,7,9,null,null,3,5], p = 2, q = 8
Output: 6
Explanation: The LCA of nodes 2 and 8 is 6.

Example 2:
Input: root = [6,2,8,0,4,7,9,null,null,3,5], p = 2, q = 4
Output: 2
Explanation: The LCA of nodes 2 and 4 is 2, since a node can be a descendant of itself according to the LCA definition.

Example 3:
Input: root = [2,1], p = 2, q = 1
Output: 2
 

Constraints:
The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [2, 105].
-109 <= Node.val <= 109
All Node.val are unique.
p != q
p and q will exist in the BST.

/*
	Algorithm

Start traversing the tree from the root node.
If both the nodes p and q are in the right subtree, then continue the search with right subtree starting step 1.
If both the nodes p and q are in the left subtree, then continue the search with left subtree starting step 1.
If both step 2 and step 3 are not true, this means we have found the node which is common to node p's and q's subtrees. and hence we return this common node as the LCA.

struct TreeNode* lowestCommonAncestor(struct TreeNode* root, struct TreeNode* p, struct TreeNode* q) {
    if(p->val > root->val && q->val > root->val){
        return lowestCommonAncestor(root->right,p,q);
    } else if(p->val < root->val && q->val < root->val){
        return lowestCommonAncestor(root->left,p,q);
    } else{
        return root;
    }
