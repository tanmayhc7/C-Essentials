/***********************************************
	342. Power of Four
Given an integer (signed 32 bits), write a function to check whether it is a power of 4.

Example 1:

Input: 16
Output: true
Example 2:

Input: 5
Output: false
Follow up: Could you solve it without loops/recursion?
************************************************/

/******************
A number n is a power of 4 if following conditions are met.
a) There is only one bit set in the binary representation of n (or n is a power of 2)
b) The bits donâ€™t AND(&) any part of the pattern 0xAAAAAAAA => since for num to be power of 4 it must have a 1 in either of the following positions=> 
	0101 0101 0101 0101 0101 0101 0101 0101 => 0x55555555
	so for number that is a power of 4 will always result > 0 when & with 0x55555555
	and also it will give zero when and with 0xAAAAAAAA
